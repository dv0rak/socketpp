socket++ v.1.5
library which offers an high-level and object-oriented interface to manipulate UNIX Inet4 sockets.
It includes these main classes:

- AddrHandler : it deals with several things, like dns resolving or address format conversion
- BaseSocket : abstract base class
- Socket : a wrapper for the C socket interface
- SocketServer : it makes easier the server construction and the multithreaded concurrent approach
- SockBuf : publicly derived from std::streambuf and BaseSocket
- SockStream : extension of std::iostream, it works with SockBuf objects, and allows the well-known stream approach with sockets
- RawSocket : family of several protocol-based raw socket classes, including TCP, ICMP, and UDP with or without IP header handling. It doesn't require programmer to perform any byte order conversion
- SockException : socket exception class
- ftp : This class tries to imitate the ftplib.FTP python class, with a few differences. Before I write the whole documentation try to adapt yourself to these differences intuitively. See the python documentation
